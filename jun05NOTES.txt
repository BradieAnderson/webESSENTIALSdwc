More bootstrap, mostly components not the grid system

if you screw around w elements in google look at html, it'll actually change stuff
on the website but won't save anything when you refresh! :D

console is for the javalogs, we've done that before but you CAN write java in the console!
so if you typed
let x = 10;
x;
it would return 10 :D

Sources will give site structure, css, pngs, javascript, source files
SO MAKE SURE TO NAME THINGS APPROPIATLY
You can also get changes on the webpage by editing this stuff that'll reset when refreshed

Network will show filters by extension/file type, font, documents, media, etc

performance
monitors webpage and records

Memory
offers the option to follow up w your dom nodes etc

Applications
Meh

Security
give you the deets of what you're viewing from and how to view certificate/etc verify the Security

Responsive device tool bar 
Allows you to test your site on multople sizes without needing to physically resize the page

you can change the settrings of this stuff to 2 different windows, top/bottom/side oriented

You can also add new classes, which will then be reflected in the styles tab but lost when refreshed

REMEMBER just because you can effect things on the web, that doesn't mean you have all the patches and downloads necessary to move their code from the web directly to your own "go live"

Bootstrap components are more static, some interactive

Nav bar, comizable to search and include image etc YOU CAN COMPLTELY CHANGE IT W CUSTOM CSS etc 

the hamburger icon is TOTALLY a bootstrap thing lol

remember bootstrap is mobile first

use utility classes sparingly, except you will need them for margin/padding lol m margine p padding l r s e

if it's shared on multiple pages, USE A STYLE SHEET
