creating another clone from your main/root, so multiple people can use the same repository but allows mutliple developers to work on it
and then y'all can push changes to the repository after reviewal into a merg

while you should try to always branch from the main, you can technically branch from another branch if you needed to

if you command line git branch, it'll show you where you're at by highlighting the text in green and adding an astrisk

If you wnat to make a new branch, you need to go to get branches add a new branch name the new branch
